# Hybrid Approach to Automated Facial Pimple Removal

##  Abstract

Facial pimples not only affect visual aesthetics but also challenge facial recognition systems. This project presents a hybrid pipeline that combines classical image processing with deep learning inpainting for automated facial pimple removal. Our method first detects pimples using adaptive LAB color thresholding and Gaussian-based local intensity difference, then removes them using OpenCV‚Äôs Telea algorithm and Deep Image Prior (DIP) based U-Net architecture.

##  Features

- **Facial Region Segmentation** using 68 dlib landmarks and 3 custom forehead points.
- **Dual Pimple Detection Methods**:
  - LAB color space adaptive thresholding.
  - Local intensity difference using Gaussian filtering.
- **Dual Inpainting Approaches**:
  - OpenCV Telea algorithm for fast inpainting.
  - Deep Image Prior (DIP) based U-Net for realistic texture generation.
- **Dynamic Selection** of the best detection method per image based on recall.
- **Quantitative & Qualitative Evaluation** with visual results and metrics.

##  Methodology

### 1. Facial Region Analysis
- Detect face using dlib HOG detector.
- Predict 68 facial landmarks + 3 additional forehead points.
- Compute convex hull to isolate the facial region.

### 2. Pimple Detection
- **LAB Color Thresholding**: Convert to LAB and threshold A channel.
- **Blur Difference**: Gaussian blur the A channel and compute difference.
- Morphological operations to clean masks.

### 3. Pimple Inpainting
- **OpenCV Telea**: Fast, diffusion-based filling.
- **DIP U-Net**: Self-supervised learning from noise input for realistic inpainting.
